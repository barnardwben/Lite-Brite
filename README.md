 Making Pictures With Light


 With this project I came up with the idea after seeing someone using JavaScript to light up elements with mouse-over and mouse-out event listeners. The user can adjust the color and click on a circle to paint their selected color.

 This site took only half a day to build.

 Where I can see improvements or added features would be to use local storage so the users can leave the page and come back to where they left off. I also would like to build in a file download functionality so the user can save their projects.
